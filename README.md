# Math Quiz App prototype
I'm practicing with JS to try to build a math game. Didn't really focus on css for now so the interface is meh. Focused more on functionality. Can be improved.
- [x] functional quiz game
- [ ] options div fixed to a position 
- [ ] randomize question sequence
- [ ] create fun timer
- [ ] add more questions??
- [ ] add pause button
